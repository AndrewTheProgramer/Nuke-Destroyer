Thank you for downloading Nuke Destroyer, these are instructions on how to play.


To aim, point your mouse at an enemy missile (don't forget the enemy missile will
keep moving)

To fire, left click or space bar, they both work

To exit the game, hit esc

To pause the game, hit p

Objective:
  The objective of the game is to protect the cities (the yellow dots), there are 
  6 cities, if a city gets hit by a nuke, the city will be destroyed, when a city
  is destroyed, you do not lose any points, but when all 6 cities are destroyed,
  the game is over. BE CAREFUL NOT TO HIT YOUR CITIES, THERE IS FRIENDLY FIRE IN
  THIS GAME. each missile you destroy grants you 10 points, be careful how much
  you fire tho, you get 30 ammo each round of enemy missiles, after the round ends
  you reset back to 30 ammo. If an enemy missile hits you (the turret), don't worry,
  that doesn't mean game over, but you cannot fire while you are in an enemy missiles
  explosion. after each round of enemy missiles, the number of enemy missiles will
  increase, after all, the game does need to get harder as you progress.


When you open the game, it will show you a high score screen, these scores ARE NOT
REAL, some of the names are nomes of some people I know tho. The scores are just
to give you a goal. But when you see this screen, press the spacebar.
